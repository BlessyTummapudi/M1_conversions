# Introduction:

In digital electronics, the number system is used for representing the information.
The number system has different bases and the most common of them are the decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
Any digital system can understand only the optional number system. In these systems, digits symbols are used to represent different values. 
The system introduced in the project makes it easier to convert a data from one representation method/ number system to other.
A person can convert data to a desired format with the help of this project in timely manner. 
Since, the digital logic circuitry requires numorous calculations of such type, it will be benificial to have such a system.

# Features:

This system supports following types of data conversions (For positive integers):
